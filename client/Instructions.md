## **Instructions For Participants**

-   Follow globally accepted coding practices such as:

    -   Use a code formatter such as the [Prettier VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

    -   Have a file listing all project dependencies to fasten dependencies installation. For e.g. in case of a Python-based project, include a [`requirements.txt` file](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-requirementstxt-explained/)

    -   Include a [`.gitignore` file](https://github.com/github/gitignore) to avoid committing irrelevant files

    -   Use 4 spaces instead of a tab

-   It is highly recommended that you deploy your project online using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/getting-started-with-vercel), [Render](https://docs.render.com/), [railway.app](https://docs.railway.app/quick-start), [Microsoft Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/deploy-a-website-with-azure-virtual-machines/) [Student Pack](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) etc.

    -   If your website-based project is not feasible to deploy online, [use ngrok to publicly expose your locally running server](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/). Include the publicly accessible URL given by ngrok in the `Access` Section

-   Local installation instructions are required
